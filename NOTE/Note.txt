/**
 * Move Models to folder (Laravel 5.6 ++)
 * Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29052267/move-laravel-5-eloquent-models-into-its-own-directory
 */

1. Move the files to the new directory
   Say you want to move the models to app/Models

2. Change the namespace of the models
   For each model change :

   namespace App;
   to

   namespace App\Models;

3. Change the references in other files
   Check these files and search especially app\User

   app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php
   config/auth.php
   config/services.php
   database/factories/UserFactory.php
   Your Controllers
   And change App/ModelExample to App/Models/ModelExample

4. Autoload files
   Run composer dump-autoload

   *Note: better to run 'php artisan config:cache' too

5. Congratulations!

 */
1. Run command "php artisan storage:link"
Expected output: The [public/storage] directory has been linked.

2. So you can storage anything in storage
* public/storage -> storage/app/public
